                <p>Stop being so hard on yourself. Everything will make sense to you one day.
                     All the pain, hurt, and frustration will become worth it. Remember, 
                     everything happens for a particular reason. You are in the exact place you are 
                     meant to be right now. So breathe, be patient, and trust the course of your life.
                      Let go of all the expectations you have created in your head. Accept reality as it comes.
                       Accept life for what it is.

                    Donâ€™t take everything so personally and try to not let others get you down.
                     Most of the time, things have nothing to do with you, and everything to do with the other person.
                      When people hurt you, try and understand their side of the story. Forgive them.
                     Learn from their wrongdoings, and then let it remain in the past. Not everything is always how it appears.</p>

                <p>As a consequence, we end up being too hard on ourselves all too often without even realising. All of us are more or less stuck 
                    up and consumed by our work, social interactions, life goals, weekend plans and so on.</p>
